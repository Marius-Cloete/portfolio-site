  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I’m a UX designer with nearly 20 year’s experience in the media industry which spans design, content creation, marketing, consumer research, audience measurement systems and marketing effectiveness. </p>
  <p>I was drawn to the field of UX because it presents a way to apply all of my cumulative experience in a creative, yet solution driven field.</p>
  <p>My background not only gives me a great understanding into what makes consumers tick, but provides me with excellent presentation and stakeholder management skills to guide organisations towards effective, consumer centred solutions.</p>
